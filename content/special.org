** The Lorentz Factor
The lorentz factor is the factor at which time is dialated, and length is contracted, among other things,
in inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames. ("The Lorentz transform equations, the addition of velocities and spacetime", n.d)

The equation to calculate the lorentz factor is:
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac 1 {\sqrt {1 - \frac {v^2} {c^2}}}
\end{equation}
where $v =$ the relative velocity of the observers,
and $c =$ the speed of light $x \approx 3 \cdot 10 ^ 8$

** Time Dialation

\begin{equation}
t = t_0 \gamma = \frac {t_0} {\sqrt {1 - \frac {v ^ 2} {c ^ 2}}}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time as mesured from an outside observer,
$t_0$ is the time mesured by the moving observer,
and $\gamma$ is the [[The Lorentz Factor]].
