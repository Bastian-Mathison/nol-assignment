Polarised light is light that is all travelling in the same orientation. ("polarization", n.d)
The polarised light's electric and magnetic fields are still perpendicular to each other,
but are forced into a specific orientation, As seen in the diagram below (from previous source).

* Malus's law
Malus's law states that polarised light with intensity ($I_0$)
going through a polarising filter will have an intensity of
\begin{equation}
I = I_0 \cos ^2 \theta
\end{equation}
