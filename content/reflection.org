The Kickstart Physics workshop, run at the University of Sydney (USYD),
to us wasn't a great help, as we had already gone over most of the content in class.

The only 'new' concept that we covered was special relativity,
however early in the year (while Mr Sumners was absent),
we got introduced to special relativity in greater depth than the workshop.

All other concepts had been covered in class in greater depth,
with more comprehensible and complete explanations of the effects.

The instructors weren't the most lively or entertaining.
The practicals were also quite confusing in some cases,
some more direction would have helped greatly.
