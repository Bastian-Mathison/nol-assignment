#+TITLE: The photoelectric effect.
#+INCLUDE: ../common/preamble.org

The photoelectric effect is the effect in which
a source of light, of sufficient frequency as to overcome the [[Binding Voltage][binding voltage]],
being shone onto a conductor will produce an electrical current.

** Why?
The reason behind the photoelectric effect is that the photons,
when they collide with the conductor,
impart some of their energy into the conductor's electrons.
This, if the photons have a high enough frequency,
will cause the electron to be ejected from the atom,
causing an electrical current.
