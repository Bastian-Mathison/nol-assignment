Polarised light in the quantum model,
is light that is all traveling in the same orientation. ("polarization", n.d)
The polarised light's electric and magnetic fields are still perpendicular to each other,
but are forced into a specific orientation, As seen in the diagram below (from previous source).

* Malus's law
Malus's law states that polarised light with intensity ($I_0$)
going through a polarising filter will have an intensity of
\begin{equation}
I = I_0 \cos^2 \theta
\end{equation}

Meaning if two polarising filters are placed at a $\frac \pi 2$ radian (90 degrees)
angle, there will be no light passing through,
($\cos^2 \left ( \frac \pi 2 \right ) = 0$).

However this model is not perfect,
this model predicts that if 3 filters are placed at
$\frac pi 4$ radians (45 degrees) apart from each other,
that 0 light will pass through.
However this is not the case, ~12.5% of light will pass through. ("The Three-Polarizer Paradox", 2020)
[[https://youtu.be/5SIxEiL8ujA][An example video]] of this effect.
This effect in the quantum model is explained by the polarised light
/strictly/ being in the orientation of the polarizing filter,
unlike the classical model where the light retains its direction.

In the case of the three polariser paradox,
by letting $\theta$ be the angle between successive filters,
the result is predicted accurately.
