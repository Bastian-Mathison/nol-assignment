#+TITLE: Special Relativity.
#+INCLUDE: ../common/preamble.org

Special relativity is an extension of gailaen relativity,
which proposes that things like time, are not constant in all reference frames,
but instead warp themselves to keep the speed (denoted $c$) of light constant.
All reference frames will observe $c$ as the same constant.

* The Lorentz Factor
The Lorentz factor is the factor at which time is dilated, and length is contracted, among other things,
in inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames.
("The Lorentz transform equations, the addition of velocities and spacetime", n.d)

The equation to calculate the Lorentz factor is:
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac 1 {\sqrt {1 - \frac {v^2} {c^2}}}
\end{equation}
where $v =$ the relative velocity of the observers,
and $c =$ the speed of light $x \approx 3 \cdot 10 ^ 8$

* Time Dilation
In Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity ("time dilation", n.d),
time dilates with a /relatively/ simple formula,
\begin{equation}
t = t_0 \gamma
\end{equation}
where $t =$ time from an outside observer,
$t_0 =$ the rest time,
and $\gamma =$ the [[The Lorentz Factor][Lorentz factor]].


** A thought experiment.
Imagine you are on a plane,
and you have a clock that measures time via a photon (light).
When the photon hits the bottom plate, one 'tick' of time is registered.

Now you see the photon going straight up and down, meaning one tick $= \frac{L}{c}$.
However to an observer on the ground, the photon takes a longer triangular path,
meaning one tick of time is seen as longer.
This cannot be with time being constant in /all/ frames of reference.
So logically time /must/ vary.
