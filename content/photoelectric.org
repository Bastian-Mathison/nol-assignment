#+TITLE: The photoelectric effect.
#+INCLUDE: ../common/preamble.org

The photoelectric effect is the effect in which
a source of light, of sufficient frequency as to overcome the [[#beng][Binding Energy]],
being shone onto a conductor will produce an electrical current.

** Why?
The reason behind the photoelectric effect is that the photons,
when they collide with the conductor,
impart some of their energy into the conductor's electrons.
This, if the photons have a high enough frequency,
will cause the electron to be ejected from the atom,
causing an electrical current.

+ _/'Binding energy'/_ (denoted $\phi$) is the energy required to
   eject an electron from its atom.
   The binding energy is very dependent on material and each material will have it's own binding energy.
+ _/'Threshold Frequency'/_ is the minimum frequency required for a photon eject an electron.

The kinetic energy of the electron after being hit with a proton is
\begin{equation}
KE = hf - \phi
\end{equation}
($h$ is plank's constant, approx $6.6 \cdot 10 ^ {-34}$ m$^2$ kg s$^{-1}$)

If, and only if, $KE > 0$ will the electron be ejected.
If $KE \leq 0$ then the electron will remain in the atom,
however there is no 'build up' of charge as predicted in the classical model,
only a single photon's energy matters.

You may have noticed that this equation does not involve amplitude,
that's because only voltage (which is the energy of a single electron)
is only dependent on the photon's frequency (which is the energy of a single photon).
Current (which is how many electrons) is dependent on the light source's amplitude (which is the amount of photons).

** $KE$ vs $f$
The above equation of $KE = hf - \phi$
takes the form of $y = mx + b$ which is the equation
for a linear relationship, this means, as $f$ increases,
$KE$ increases at a steady rate ($\frac {d KE} {d f} = h$).
Shown below is an example graph of a $KE$ vs $f$ graph.
