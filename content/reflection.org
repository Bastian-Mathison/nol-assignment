The Kickstart Physics workshop, run at the University of Sydney (USYD), 
to us wasn't a great help, as we had already gone over most of the content in class.
The practical demonstrations done were somewhat boring with one of the three instructors.

The only 'new' concept that we covered was special relativity, 
however early in the year (while Mr Sumners was absent), 
we got introduced to special relativity in greater depth than the workshop.
 
 All other concepts had been covered in class in greater depth,
 with more comprehensible and complete explanations of the effects.
